  isolation_segments_intro: To enable isolation segments, an operator must install the Isolation Segment tile by performing the procedures in [Installing Isolation Segment](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-11/customizing/installing-pcf-is.html). Installing the tile creates a single isolation segment.
  isolation_segments_create: After you install the Isolation Segment tile, you must register it with Cloud Controller. If you only install the Isolation Segment tile without registering the isolation segment it creates, Cloud Controller does not detect the isolation segment and cannot place apps on it.
  isolation_segments_note: <p class="note"><strong>Note<span>:</span></strong> The isolation segment name used in the cf CLI command must match the value specified in the <strong>Segment name</strong> field of the Isolation Segment tile. If the names do not match, Ops Manager fails to place apps in the isolation segment when apps are started or restarted in the space assigned to the isolation segment.</p>

  internal_domain_config: <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>&#58; The internal domain used for service discovery is <code>apps.internal</code> by default. Operators can modify this value in <strong>App Developer Controls</strong> pane of the TAS for VMs tile.</p>
  mutual_tls_tcp: <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you have mutual TLS app identity verification enabled, app containers accept incoming communication only from the Gorouter. This disables TCP routing.</p>
  support_note: <p>This buildpack is currently not supported in Ops Manager.</p>
  router_tls_recommend: <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> To ensure traffic is sent to the platform securely, VMware recommends as a minimum that you terminate TLS at the Gorouter. You can optionally terminate TLS at the load balancer.</p>

  app_graceful_shutdown_config: If your apps require a longer period of time to finish in-flight jobs and gracefully shut down, you can increase the graceful shutdown period. For more information, see the [Configure Advanced Features](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-11/operating/configure-pas.html#advanced) section of the _Configuring TAS for VMs_ topic.

  isolation_segments_smoke_tests: <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you run smoke tests as a post-deploy errand in the Isolation Segment tile, the smoke tests check if your isolation segment is registered in the CCDB. If the isolation segment is not registered, the smoke tests register it in the CCDB. This eliminates the need to manually register an isolation segment with <code>cf create-isolation-segment</code>. For more information, see <a href="../operating/installing-pcf-is.html#smoke-tests">Smoke Tests</a> in <em>Installing Isolation Segment</em>.</p>
